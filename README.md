The MOUSE programming project

Tis is a project (attempted) to build the MOUSE programming language interpreter 
as described by Peter Grogono in his book "MOUSE: A Programming Language for Microcomputers", 
published in 1983.

It is also a project to help me increase my use of C and C++, as well as other C-like 
languages.  

You'll find folders for the interpreter in each language.

This is just a beginning as I'm coding the language while reading the book.  Be patient.

But, feel free to fork at any time, as long as you give Mr. Grogono the credit.
